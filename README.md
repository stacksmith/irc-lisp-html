irc-lisp-html
=============

Lisp IRC log as a large html file, with coming/going noise removed, and formatted for readability.

<b>clone it</b>, then git pull every now and then to keep it up to date.

Don't download the whole file - use git.  It is very efficient at sending just the updated parts of the file!
